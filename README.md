This is my version of the "**Use an API to Create an Employee Directory**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Frontend Web Development Techdegree**.

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.
The png-images in the starter-files directory show how the project should look like.
