This is my version of the "**Use an API to Create an Employee Directory**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Frontend Web Development & Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree**.

I had to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

First I requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.

I received an "Exceeds Expectation" grade upon submitting the project.

The png-images in the starter-files directory show how the project should look like.
